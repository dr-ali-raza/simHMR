# simHMR
This Matlab-based simulator is aimed to provide a research tool to engineers and roboticists to design robotic systems with heterogeneity and dynamic-reconfigurability. 
The simulator can also be used as a testing and benchmarking tool for different mobile robotic systems

The users can start exploring the demos. 
1. The first one 'demo_simRN' will allow the users to simulate different mobile robot configurations to navigate in different 
unstructured scenarios. 
2. The second 'demo_simIbDR' will illustrate the simulator's ability to dynamically arbitrate the robot configurations to handle the unknown environments.
3. The third demo 'demo_sim4WD' is included to illustrate the ability of simulator to navigate a holonomic 4WD robot in multitude of different settings using probabilistic roadmaps.
4. Alternatively, one can also use the UIs to help one out in configuring the arenas, different robots and then simulating 'em in different settings.

But most importantly, the simulator provides a multitude of different tools to allow robot-heterogeneity and reconfigurablity in robotic systems.
